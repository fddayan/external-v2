We vendored update.min.js from http://browser-update.org/update.min.js because we want to be able to run the browser check code synchronously instead of waiting to load a 3rd-party dependency. We want to run the browser check synchronously so that if a browser is unsupported, we don't execute any app code. And we do that because certain browsers (IE 10, Safari < 7) don't default to a secure version of TLS and we don't want these browsers to send any API calls, which would normally happen during app init.

We also vendered update.show.min.js because update.min.js depends on it. Leaving update.min.js to fetch update.show.min.js from browser-update.org is risky because the internals of their scripts may change. To vendor, we change the `domain` flag in `index.html.ejs` to be blank, meaning update.min.js will fetch `/update.show.min.js`. To expose `/update.show.min.js`, we use the CopyWebpackPlugin to move the file directly to the build directory. From there, the frontend's deploy step will copy the build directory directly to the S3 bucket.

We may need to update the vendored file from time to time.
